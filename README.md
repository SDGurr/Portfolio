This repostory contains PDF documents with three writing samples: a URL to the public-facing portion of the API help I created for Opala; the NetSolutions *HL7 Trigger Events & Message Definitions* manual that I created for Cantata Health; and the *ADT* (Admit, Discharge, Transfer) manual I created for Cantata Health.

No password is necessary to download these PDFs.
